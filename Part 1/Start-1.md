# Installing Python

## Python Installation

To start, we head to https://www.python.org/downloads/, and press the download button.

Next, press **Install Now** to proceed with the installation.

Once the program finishes installing, close the installation.

## Code Editor Installation

All code needs to be written in an editor. The one we'll be using is my personal favorite, **Visual Studio Code.** To start, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and install the editor with the operating system you're using.

When you're in the installation, accept the agreement, and click on **Next** for every other step. If you're tech-savvy enough, you can change the options if you wish. Otherwise, the finish the setup, and open VSCode.

Before we make a project, we have to install some useful extensions. Press **Ctrl+Shift+X** (On Mac, Ctrl = Command) to get to the extensions page.

In the search bar, look up **Python**, and install the extension from Microsoft. Once it's done installing, we can finally make a new file.

Go to `File -> New File` in the top bar and choose **Python File.** Press **Ctrl+S** to save the file somewhere once you create it.

Now you can type `print("Your Text Here")` to print anything you want to the console. Then go to `Run -> Start Debugging` at the top bar and run the file. A terminal window should pop up.

**Your output will always be the white text under all the blue jargon.*

Once you're done playing around, head over to the next step, where we learn about the basics, starting with Variables.

## Syntax

The syntax is like the "command" used in a line of code. I will be putting a section at the bottom for every lesson to give a review on which syntax we learned. For example, in this lesson, we learned the `print` command.

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `print` | Outputs anything you write in the terminal. |
