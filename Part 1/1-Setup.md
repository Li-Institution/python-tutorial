Once the program finishes installing, close the installation.

## Code Editor Installation

All code needs to be written in an editor. The one we'll be using is my personal favorite, **Visual Studio Code.** To start, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and install the editor with the operating system you're using.

When you're in the installation, accept the agreement, and click on **Next** for every other step. If you're tech-savvy enough, you can change the options if you wish. Otherwise, the finish the setup, and open VSCode.

Before we make a project, we have to install some useful extensions. Press **Ctrl+Shift+X** (On Mac, Ctrl = Command) to get to the extensions page.

In the search bar, look up **Python**, and install the extension from Microsoft. Once it's done installing, we can finally make a new file.

Go to `File -> New File` in the top bar and choose **Python File.** Press **Ctrl+S** to save the file somewhere once you create it.

Great! You've just created a Python file. All the code you write will be written inside files like these.
