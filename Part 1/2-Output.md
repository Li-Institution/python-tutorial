# Input and Output

The most basic form of Python is input/output; that is, processing the data that the user has inputted, and printing it out into the command prompt/terminal. You will be working with mostly input/output while learning the fundamentals of Python programming, before moving onto the advanced shit, like making a game, or setting up a web server. Yes, you can create those in Python. In the meantime, be patient.

The way you collect input and display output in Python is through these "functions": `input()` and `print()`. Exactly what a "function" means in Python, we'll talk about in a later section. We'll talk about `input()` more in depth in a later section, since any descriptions I use here will probably be too advanced for your pathetic brain to understand. For now, let's briefly talk about `print()`:

If you are a beginner to programming, this syntax ("syntax" basically means programming grammar) will be unfamiliar to you. But essentially, whenever we call the function `print()`, we are going to be printing out whatever is in between those brackets. For example:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

This will print out the text "Hello World!" into your command prompt or terminal, or wherever you are running Python from, like so:
